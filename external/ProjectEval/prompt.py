Ensure the code style, comments, and placeholders are clean and consistent across all projects.\n\n4. **Specific Adjustments**:  \n   - Replace incomplete or inconsistent docstrings with meaningful placeholders like:  \n     \npython\n     """\n     Brief description of the function\'s purpose.\n     """\n  \n   - Ensure imports are grouped logically at the top.  \n   - Use consistent naming conventions for variables, file paths, and methods.  \n   - Retain project-specific logic while ensuring stylistic consistency.\n\n5. **Example Output**:  \n   Here\'s the desired structure for any given project:  \n   \njson\n[\n       {{\n         "file": "file_name.py",\n         "path": "file_name.py",\n         "code": "import module\n\n# Global variables\ninput_file = "input_file.xlsx"\noutput_file = "output_file.xlsx"\n\ndef function_name():\n    """\n    Brief description of function.\n    """\n    pass\n\ndef main():\n    """\n    Main execution function.\n    """\n    pass\n\nif __name__ == "__main__":\n    main()"\n       }},\n\t   {{\n\t   ...\n\t   }},\n\t   ...\n]\n'
